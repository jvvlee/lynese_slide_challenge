Hi Lynese,

This is a skeleton html file for Thursday. Contained within is an html file that has a simple html skeleton and some image elements and some buttons. Each has specific classes for you to use with jquery to create a functioning slideshow.

Some tips to proceed:
- A slideshow doesn't necessarily need to slide. Most slideshows are implemented by just hiding the elements of the slideshow you don't want to show and only showing the element you do want to show.
- To keep track of which slide you want to show, you should put a class on it. Then you can just call $(".yourclass") to select it.
- There are button elements in the html file, attach your jQuery functions to those! (Remember the syntax is: $("someElement").click(function () {Your code here} Remember you can also use classes and IDs here!)
- I've included jQuery already so you can just stick your code in a script tag! Remember $(function () {your code})! This runs your code AFTER the page has been loaded. (Check our work from last week if you need a reminder)

Let me know if you have any questions or need help!
